This repository contains example code content supporting the DerbyCon 2019 presentation, Scientific Computing for Information Security - Forging the missing link. The code can be used as examples to iterate and develop further use cases. Future versions of this code will be expanded to support additional toolsets and better modularized for efficiency. The presentation content can also be accessed at https://www.slideshare.net/ryanelkins13/2019-derbycon-ryan-elkins-scientific-computing-for-information-security.

An option to quickly get started with Jupyter notebooks is to install Anaconda along with the corresponding Python libraries.
